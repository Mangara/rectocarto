# RectoCarto

RectoCarto is a tool to generate Rectangular Cartograms.

## Work in Progress

Most of the code (in the `rectangularcartogram` package) was written for my Masters thesis. I started to modernize it (in `rectocarto`), but this is far from complete.

## Getting Started

To build the project, open it with a recent version of [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/).
