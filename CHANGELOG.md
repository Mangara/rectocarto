Example of a more complicated release:

## [0.0.7] - 2015-02-16
### Added
- Link, and make it obvious that date format is ISO 8601.

### Changed
- Clarified the section on "Is there a standard change log format?".

### Fixed
- Fix Markdown links to tag comparison URL with footnote-style links.

### Removed
- Remove empty sections from CHANGELOG, they occupy too much space and
create too much noise in the file. People will have to assume that the
missing sections were intentionally left out because they contained no
notable changes.
